> How you can occur in two places at once. How the ocean<br/>
> alters pale green to light-lost gunmetal. I had no idea this capacity<br/><br/>
> existed, until the sky exposed its huge dry self.<br/>
> Unobstructed. The sway between rooms. Ballet of tenses.<br/>
> A decade, a swarm of mayflies, cast skin,<br/>
> light intensity their cue for emergence.<br/>
> The solar eclipse in totality. Two-minute night. A ring<br/>
> in the ears. The way we're only one dimension<br/>
> away from time travel. Oh, imagined life.<br/>
> I slip you over my forearms like ice. The hind leg of a grasshopper<br/>
> mid-bound. Portals open and shut like riptides.<br/><br/>
> Shores recede. Sandbars in the mouth. I want to change enough times<br/>
> as to be hardly<br/>
> recognizable as mammal.<br/><br/>
> Sweet fin-legged future, with your salt skin and baleen teeth, beat me<br/>
> against the reef, force a different mode of breathing.
