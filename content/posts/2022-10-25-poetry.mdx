> Inside this disused tool-shed in Hammer Wood<br/>
> slatted walls morse daylight on an earth floor.<br/>
> Here two local boys find a knife, its blade<br/>
> freckled in rust. The older boy picks it up,<br/>
> with its egg whiff of wet metal, and points<br/>
> to his friend to back against the wall for a trick.<br/>
> Then the younger boy's T-shirt is hustled<br/>
> over his head and rolled into a blindfold.<br/>
> In its blackness, he imagines the moment held<br/>
> like a knife above his friend's head. His friend<br/>
> who whispers. Don't. Move. And then<br/>
> there's a kiss. Lips quickly snipping against his.<br/>
> Silence. He's aware of his chest, the negative<br/>
> of his T-shirt. He pulls his blindfold. Looks<br/>
> the older boy full in his up-close face. And sees<br/>
> that he's bleeding, everywhere, under his skin.
