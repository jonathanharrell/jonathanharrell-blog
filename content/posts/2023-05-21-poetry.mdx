> If you could be a horseman riding<br/>
> bareback through the winds and rains<br/>
> on a transparent horse<br/>
> constantly buffeted<br/>
> by the velocity of your mount<br/>
> if you could ride hard<br/>
> until your clothes were cast off far behind you<br/>
> because there is no need of clothes<br/>
> until reins were done with<br/>
> because there is no need of reins<br/>
> until your shadow was cast far behind you<br/>
> because there's no need of a shadow<br/>
> and then you might see countryside not as countryside<br/>
> but a fistful of air<br/>
> if only you could cast the horse far behind you<br/>
> and ride on, on yourself
> <cite>The Desire to Be Oneself, by Homero Aridjis</cite>
