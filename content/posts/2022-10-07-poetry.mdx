> The dog outside won't stop swallowing the city<br/>

> about the fuss, wanting to know what cruel somebody<br/>
> abandoned such loyalty—some Golden Retriever,<br/>
> some snip-tailed Rottweiler, who knows. Next to me,<br/>
> he is asleep, the one I love, the one who promised me<br/>
> a dog in the long seasons to come. He says when the sun<br/>
> is at its most weary, when the sky collapses into the Cascades,<br/>
> when the wounds of autumn vanish into miles of snowy flesh,<br/>
> then. The truth is, who knows what will happen to either of us.<br/>
> We are always one bullet away from the graveyard,<br/>
> a murder of memorial hymns. And if that's the room<br/>
> we've been born into, why do sparrows break the morning with song?<br/>
> Why do fir trees fight bark and root for their green?<br/>
> Sometimes I hear the Earth's sunken voice saying,<br/>
> Come home, come home. And who am I to argue with the one<br/>
> who has given us so much? But dear eager Earth, I want him<br/>
> to live forever. I want the dog outside to have met my dead dog.<br/>
> I hardly think of him, of how our neighbors shouted at us to shut him up.<br/>
> One day they did it for us, poured searing water onto his body.<br/>
> The grass around him became shredded hairs. The flies fevered<br/>
> and worried. I watched what happened to an animal unwelcomed,<br/>
> underserved. When I tell him this as he armors himself for the day,<br/>
> he says that will never happen again. Oh, to be as certain as wind!<br/>
> Not true, I want to say, but I can't have everything. I can't<br/>
> have the yellow from the small patch of dandelions, can't have<br/>
> the echo of laughter rolling over rooftops, over the hush<br/>
> of engines and bicycle bells, can't bring the dead back to life.<br/>
> We won't live forever, but I am afraid some wrong citizen<br/>
> will mistake him for a scar on the neighborhood—they will<br/>
> take him from me. I settle with a covering spell: Stay safe.<br/>
> He walks out the door and into a spray of sirens.
