Reflections at the Golden Pavilion,<br/>
Beside burning incense and an ocean of stones.

Chasing foxes at Fushimi Inari Shrine,<br/>
Where torii run away from me,<br/>
As if reflected endlessly in a mirror.

Kyoto sunlight striking over kanji,<br/>
Breaking through forests of bamboo.

Faces frozen in stone,<br/>
At peace or silently screaming,<br/>
Gnashing their moss-covered teeth.

I, like the fish, follow the sunlight,<br/>
And swim in the shadow of Nijo trees.

Where there are gates and demons, I turn away.

I follow the sunset path to Kiyomizudera,<br/>
And watch the shadows take Kyoto.
