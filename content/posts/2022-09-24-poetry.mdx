> He who wants to remember, and is full of darkness himself, must stand by the brim of himself as by a well,<br/><br/>
> he must lean over the well with a stone in his hand and ask himself what the well hides, how deep it is, how distant the light that reaches him,<br/><br/>
> and he must, to be able to know the depth and the darkness of the well, throw the stone and see it slowly fall, as if thoughtfully, as if hanging in empty nothingness, until it is no longer seen<br/><br/>
> and he remains standing and waits by the brim of himself, leaning forward, until the stone hits the hitherto invisible water's surface<br/><br/>
> and he who wants to remember can see how the deep suddenly sparks, attracts the light, becomes living as when an eye opens, and he is recognized by another eye below.
> <cite>The well, by Lasse SÃ¶derberg</cite>
