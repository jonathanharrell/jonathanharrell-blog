> The fly couldn't hold<br/>
> but buzzed and flailed<br/>
> on my kitchen floor,<br/>
> its wires throwing lost signals<br/>
> the way a phone rings<br/>
> unanswered in a room.<br/>
> Its sensilla retained the dust of a grape<br/>
> as you must surely feel the last sweet air<br/>
> before reaching the point<br/>
> where the brain unplugs its love<br/>
> and looks sideways.
> <cite>Sister in a Coma, by Suzanne Underwood Rhodes</cite>
