> ... You must not grieve that the world is glimpsed<br/>
> Through veils. How else can it be seen?<br/>
> How will you rip away the veil of the eye, the veil<br/>
> That you are, you who want to grasp the heart<br/>
> Of things, hungry to know where meaning<br/>
> Lies. Taste what you hold in your hands: onion-juice,<br/>
> Yellow peels, my stinging shreds. You are the one<br/>
> In pieces. Whatever you meant to love, in meaning to<br/>
> You changed yourself: you are not who you are,<br/>
> Your soul cut moment to moment by a blade<br/>
> Of fresh desire, the ground sown with abandoned skins.<br/>
> And at your inmost circle, what? A core that is<br/>
> Not one. Poor fool, you are divided at the heart,<br/>
> Lost in its maze of chambers, blood, and love,<br/>
> A heart that will one day beat you to death.
