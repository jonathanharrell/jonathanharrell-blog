> ... And over the pond's lone island the willow spills its canopy,<br/>
> A shifting feast of gold and green, a spell of lethal beauty.<br/>
> O bird of moonlight. O bird of wish. O sound rising<br/>
> Like an echo from the water. Grief sound. Sound of the horn.<br/>
> The same ghostly sound the deer makes when it runs<br/>
> Through the woods at night, white lightning through the trees,<br/>
> Through the coldest moments, when it feels as if the earth<br/>
> Will never again grow warm, lover running toward lover,<br/>
> The branches tearing back, the mouth and eyes wide,<br/>
> The heart flying into the arms of the one that will kill her.
