> Each year I lose a little more of it,<br/>
> the spaces between the vertebrae<br/>
> slowly sighing closed<br/>
> like an accordion that after<br/>
> a full day of playing dances<br/>
> lets out a long atonal breathâ€”<br/>
> the exhalation<br/>
> of every song it ever made<br/>
> as the musician prepares<br/>
> to lay the instrument<br/>
> gently in its box.
