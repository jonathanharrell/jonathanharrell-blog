> Down valley a smoke haze<br/>
> Three days heat, after five days rain<br/>
> Pitch glows on the fir-cones<br/>
> Across rocks and meadows<br/>
> Swarms of new flies.<br/>
>
> I cannot remember things I once read<br/>
> A few friends, but they are in cities.<br/>
> Drinking cold snow-water from a tin cup<br/>
> Looking down for miles<br/>
> Through high still air.
> <cite>Mid-August at Sourdough Mountain Lookout, by Gary Snyder</cite>
