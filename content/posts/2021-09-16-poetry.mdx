> ... After she left, the vision<br/>
> of her nude loomed<br/>
> upon the silver of the mirror. I walked toward it,<br/>
> taking off my clothes. That small body<br/>
> whose desire is not by nature’s strict design. My skin<br/>
> smelled like rain, naked. My hair<br/>
> smelled like the black black earth.<br/>
>
> Eyes closed, I ran fingers over my clavicle, playing<br/>
> a silent instrument. On the balcony, a mantis leaped<br/>
> & became a part of a leaf. I thought of myself<br/>
> spending a whole afternoon staring<br/>
> at a tree, thinking myself a tree.<br/>
>
> I thought of the painting, how strokes of desire<br/>
> poured out of a motionless body perpetually moving;<br/>
> how loneliness dissected that body<br/>
> without a galloping thrash. Fear to smash a cello<br/>
> & find there was no music inside. To admit it was fingers<br/>
> that made music, it was looking that made beauty.<br/>
> Not me.<br/>
> Not me.<br/>
>
> I look into the mirror, as if through my cousin’s eyes—<br/>
> that afternoon, in the rosemary alley, a boy<br/>
> was kissed by another boy, & both of them tasted of blueberry.
