> See Mount Soracte shining in the snow.<br/>
> See how the laboring overladen trees<br/>
> Can scarcely bear their burdens any longer.<br/><br/>
> See how the streams are frozen in the cold.<br/>
> Bring in the wood and light the fire and open<br/>
> The fourth-year vintage wine in the Sabine jars.<br/><br/>
> O Thaliarchus, as for everything else,<br/>
> Forget tomorrow. Leave it up to the gods.<br/>
> Once the gods have decided, the winds at sea<br/><br/>
> Will quiet down, and the sea will quiet down,<br/>
> And these cypresses and old ash trees will shake<br/>
> In the storm no longer. Take everything as it comes.<br/><br/>
> Put down in your books as profit every new day<br/>
> That Fortune allows you to have. While you’re still young,<br/>
> And while morose old age is far away,<br/><br/>
> There’s love, there are parties, there’s dancing and there’s music,<br/>
> There are young people out in the city squares together<br/>
> As evening comes on, there are whispers of lovers, there’s laughter.
> <cite>i.9 / To Thaliarchus, by Horace</cite>
