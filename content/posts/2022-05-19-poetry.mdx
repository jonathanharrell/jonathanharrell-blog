> I boarded the Blue Line at Aquarium station.<br/>
> The only empty seat was the one by that young,<br/>
> Head back, eyes closed, exhausted-looking father<br/>
> Holding his sleeping child in his folded arms.<br/>
> It was already suppertime, and the Evening Star,<br/>
> As Sappho sings, was calling all of the creatures<br/>
> Home to their mother, through the rush-hour traffic.<br/>
> The subway was coming out of the tunnel's mouth<br/>
> And I was sixty when I suddenly felt<br/>
> A tiny hand start pulling at my sleeve.<br/>
> In his sleep the child I never had was reaching<br/>
> Out for me, while the father I never became<br/>
> Kept his eyes shut. And all the way to my stop<br/>
> At Orient Heights, nothing disturbed our dream.
