> Will you then lie spent on the cool<br/>
> mushroom bed when you are down again<br/>
> by the mill-track and the fernery?<br/>
> Will you contemplate the stupid grapefruit,<br/>
> the tedious eggplant, the intellectual thorn?<br/>
> And will you wake up fresh and confused<br/>
> in a place you have been borne to for asylum<br/>
> like a chick just hatched from a fire-colored egg?<br/>
> And will you see the starships<br/>
> drifting over rain-colored mountains?<br/>
> The copper-streaked leaves<br/>
> that shine in the pattering rain?
> <cite>The Octagon House, by Geoffrey Nutter (excerpt)</cite>
