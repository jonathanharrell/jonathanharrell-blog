> Those who live to have it and<br/>

> Of course there are those for whom both are true,<br/>

> Those who have it to give are<br/>

> except for those who would prey upon them:<br/>
> all that softness and quaking and blood.<br/>
> Those who want it<br/>

> any furred thing will do. So easy<br/>
> to rip out a heart when it is throbbing so hard.<br/>
> I wander out into the winter.<br/>
> I know what I am.
