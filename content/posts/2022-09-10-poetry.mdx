> I dreamt I was showing my brother around in Hell.<br/>
> We started inside the house.<br/>
> Everything was brown besides the white sheets<br/>
> in the bedrooms. I let him look<br/>
> outside the window, told him it was hottest there,<br/>
> where the flames rolled against the glass,<br/>
> as if a giant mouth were blowing them,<br/>
> as if there were thousands caught in the storm,<br/>
> pushing it onward with mindless running,<br/>
> save a desperation for something else.<br/>
> How had there been a house in Hell<br/>
> and we invited with time to spend? Why was it<br/>
> I hadn't questioned how I got there? My brother<br/>
> growing so tired from the heat, the sweating?<br/><i>Surely we could open the door</i>, he said. <i>Surely there'll be</i><br/><i>a breeze</i>. Even seeing already, even burning himself<br/>
> on the doorknob. His eyes turned back in his head<br/>
> working his way to the bedrooms, staining<br/>
> the sheets with his blistered hands, and though I knew the beds<br/>
> weren't for the rest of any body, I sat by and let him sleep.
