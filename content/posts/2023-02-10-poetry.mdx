> The house next door is all one room.<br/>
> No one lives there.<br/>
> The house next door is one big room.<br/>
> A furnace in the center.<br/><br/>
> Last night, I walked in.<br/>
> No one has lived there for years.<br/>
> Iâ€™m telling you now, the scarred furnace was lit.<br/>
> Inside, flames tethered to coals.<br/><br/>
> There was nothing on the walls.<br/>
> Except a single painting of a painting:<br/>
> a room with a furnace.<br/>
> I am reporting back so you know.<br/><br/>
> I removed the painting to find a hole in the wall.<br/>
> Copper wires humming a ghost harmony.<br/>
> Your name was scratched into the picture frame.<br/>
> I put the painting back.<br/><br/>
> The furnace inhaled its flames.<br/>
> It went cold.<br/>
> I walked out the door to no one.<br/>
> I was on fire.
