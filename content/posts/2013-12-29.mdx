Winter runs through the stones at Taejongdae,<br/>
Chilling the strata, turning them blue.

There is sunfire on the heights of Mount Geumjeong.<br/>
The last of the year, before the chill comes,<br/>
And the world falls into darkness.

Cold winds blow over the sea,<br/>
Cold waves crash over the rocks,<br/>
And candlelight is all we have left.
