> When sidelong hours reach deep<br/>
> into the house, objects turn<br/>
> unbearably distinct and I think<br/>
> of girlhood, how the sinking golden light<br/>
> had to be seized, like the last<br/>
> mouthful of soda in a warm can shared<br/>
> with my sister. Whether I wanted to or not,<br/>
> I climbed higher in the tree, higher<br/>
> than I even liked, to watch the back door<br/>
> where my mother would appear<br/>
> and call me in. For years now<br/>
> a supper made by someone else<br/>
> is all I want, but this late sun<br/>
> keeps pressing in. The linen chair<br/>
> beside the window looks more<br/>
> salmon-hued and woven now<br/>
> than at noon. And the not-chair<br/>
> stretches long beside it. Shadows<br/>
> sharpen and themselves become<br/>
> objects filling the room. A child wakes<br/>
> down the hall. Light gathers on the faces<br/>
> of ranunculus in a mantle vase,<br/>
> browning and collapsing<br/>
> in their centers. I think I have been<br/>
> sad every afternoon of my life.<br/>
> Outside a child runs in the grass.<br/>
> Soon I will appear and call her to me.
