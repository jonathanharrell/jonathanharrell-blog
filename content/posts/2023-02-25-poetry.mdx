> In the hard shadow of the moon<br/>
> when the recesses of light have gone<br/>
> and the faint red of the hawk's shoulder has disappeared from the sky<br/>
> in the growing pulse of the praying mantis<br/>
> when the city has come into its own new light<br/>
> it is here where I often remember:<br/><br/>
> the weaving of ocean vines<br/>
> the trails of history, cemented by touch<br/>
> the small ridged blossom of the cowrie shell<br/>
> the indigo dye made radiant by the seller's basket.<br/><br/>
> The way the long grass<br/>
> emerges at the shore.<br/>
> Something of that meeting.<br/><br/>
> These are memories both distant and near<br/>
> traces of them lived and felt<br/>
> laughing in the company of the ones who came<br/>
> holding the silence of the moment, as we stare<br/>
> with wonder, at the bubbling ruptures of a painter's canvas,<br/>
> pull, with care, the clinging skin of a stubborn fruit.<br/><br/>
> I recall these moments<br/>
> not from the grand gesture<br/>
> of a thing once known,<br/>
> but from a small place,<br/>
> the place where my child's hand<br/>
> is hidden warmly inside my own.
