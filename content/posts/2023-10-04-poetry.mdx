> And out of nothing, breath.<br/>
> A beast-like shadow in the glass.<br/>
> If I brought back every feeling I had<br/>
> where would I put them,<br/>
> what could they mean<br/>
> to this world on the floor?<br/>
> It was best to let the moon unravel<br/>
> and focus the truth of the music.<br/>
> It was best to let the music<br/>
> unravel and focus the truth of night.<br/>
> Like when I found you<br/>
> in the back of my mind.<br/>
> I am talking about people<br/>
> and the night.<br/>
> People inside the night.<br/>
> The night and what we are made of.<br/>
> The things and the people.<br/>
> The signal and its noise.
