> I chose your grave clothes with care,<br/>
> your favourite stripey shirt,<br/>
>
> your blue cotton trousers.<br/>
> They smelt of woodsmoke, of October,<br/>
>
> your own smell there too.<br/>
> I chose a gansy of handspun wool,<br/>
>
> warm and fleecy for you. It is<br/>
> so cold down in the dark.<br/>
>
> No light can reach you and teach you<br/>
> the paths of wild birds,<br/>
>
> the names of the flowers,<br/>
> the fishes, the creatures.<br/>
>
> Ignorant you must remain<br/>
> of the sun and its work,<br/>
>
> my lamb, my calf, my eaglet,<br/>
> my cub, my kid, my nestling,<br/>
>
> my suckling, my colt. I would spin<br/>
> time back, take you again<br/>
>
> within my womb, your amniotic lair,<br/>
> and further spin you back<br/>
>
> through nine waxing months<br/>
> to the split seeding moment<br/>
>
> you chose to be made flesh,<br/>
> word within me.<br/>
>
> I'd cancel the love feast<br/>
> the hot night of your making.<br/>
>
> I would travel alone<br/>
> to a quiet mossy place,<br/>
>
> you would spill from me into the earth<br/>
> drop by bright red drop.
