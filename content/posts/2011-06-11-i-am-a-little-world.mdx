Experiments in high-speed photography with [@lejeunerenard](https://twitter.com/lejeunerenard). A visual exploration of John Donne's [Holy Sonnet](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44108/holy-sonnets-i-am-a-little-world-made-cunningly). A representation of the power of the elements to purify and renew through destruction.

> I am a little world made cunningly<br/>
> Of elements and an angelic sprite

> But black sin hath betray'd to endless night<br/>
> My world's both parts, and oh both parts must die.

> Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might<br/>
> Drown my world with my weeping earnestly

> But oh it must be burnt; alas the fire<br/>
> Of lust and envy have burnt it heretofore<br/>
> And made it fouler

> Let their flames retire,<br/>
> And burn me O Lord, with a fiery zeal<br/>
> Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating heal.
