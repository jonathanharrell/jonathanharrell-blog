> ... I want to be an earthquake<br/>
> To shake the idle hearts<br/>
> I want to place in every heart<br/>
> An earthquake of wisdom<br/>
> I want to snatch a cloud<br/>
> And hide it in my bed<br/>
> I want the thieves to steal my bed<br/>
> And hide it in a cloud<br/>
> I want to make every word a tree, a loaf of bread or a kiss<br/>
> I wish for whoever does not love trees<br/>
> Bread<br/>
> And kisses<br/>
> To stop talking
> <cite>Wishes, by Riad al-Saleh al-Hussein (excerpt)</cite>
