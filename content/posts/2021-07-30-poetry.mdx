> ... And we watched their wanting<br/>
>
> from a blind weâ€™d erected in our living room,<br/>
> and we watched as they waded, timid at first,<br/>

> into the liquid crystals of the television.<br/>
>
> Then, more swiftly, their daggers clenched<br/>
> between their teeth, they slipped beneath<br/>
>
> its pixilated surface.
